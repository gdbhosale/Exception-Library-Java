# Exception Library in Java

Generally while dealing with big Java project we need to handle so many exception at so many places.

Sometimes same exception comes at many places. In all such cases the Exception Handling logic remaining same for a Exception.

There are some standard processes which we follow in order to complete exception handling...

1.  Sending error message via email
2.  Log the exception in log file
3.  retry the try block again for 3 times with interval of 2 minutes
4.  Anything Extra if needed
